Once she has identified a suitable target, she should aim and fire the rifle, using the appropriate ammunition for the target. After the shot, she should quickly reposition herself to avoid being detected and continue observing the area for any additional threats or opportunities. The key to a successful ambush is to remain vigilant, patient, and adaptable to changing circumstances.", "step": "4"}
